# heart - 
In this project there is heart related data is given.then import all the liabraries and load the dataset.split the x and y and then use KNeighborsClassifier calculate the accuracy of that model.

Workflow-
Importing liabraries,
Loading dataset,
Model Creation,
Hyperparameter tunning

Installation - 
Numpy,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn

Conclusion - 
Using hyperparameter tunning it gives the accuracy is 0.71
